As each infographic, chart or data visulization varies from case to case, this documentation is meant to serve as a set of guidelines. Adhering to these guidelines leads to a more consistent presentation of design work in NZZ\'s print and online media.\n\n### Component Stability Index\n\n In order to clearly indicate which components\xa0described in this documentation can be considered stable or unstable, we have introduced a \xabStability Index\xbb. Each of the key components within the documentation can be matched to one of the three different stability levels described below.\n\n##### Stability: 1 \u2013 Experimental\n```html|span-1,no-source,plain\n<div class="stabilityIndex experimental">Experimental</div>\n```\nThis component is still under heavy construction and may be subject to profound change or completely removed.\n**DO NOT USE**\n\n##### Stability: 2 \u2013 Unstable\n```html|span-1,no-source,plain\n<div class="stabilityIndex unstable">Unstable</div>\n```\nThe component\u2019s functionality and styling are to be considered a \xabdraft\xbb and are not yet approved by the key stakeholders.\nThere might still be some changes made to the component in the future.\n**USE WITH CAUTION**\n\n##### Stability: 3 \u2013 Stable\n```html|span-1,no-source,plain\n<div class="stabilityIndex stable">Stable</div>\n```\nFunctionality and styling are considered to be complete and should not change unless serious issues are encountered.\nStable components are approved by the key stakeholders and can be generally considered \xabready-to-use\xbb.\n**READY TO USE**\n\n\n# Changelog\n\n---\n\n```table\nspan: 6\ncolumns:\n  - Version\n  - Date\n  - Changes\nrows:\n  - Changes: |\n      Initial *Annotation* documentation.\n    Date: 2018-01-15\n    Version: 0.1.1\n  - Changes: |\n      Set-up Catalog\n    Date: 2018-01-12\n    Version: 0.1.0\n```\n'}});
