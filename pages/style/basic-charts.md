Almost all basic charts for our online platform are done in Q. Only charts with details and annotations that are not possible in Q should be designed and uploaded through Q's Infographic tool. The print template for basic charts can be downloaded via the [assets page](assets).

Basic bar charts are usually used for showing categorized data over time or comparing. Stacking bars are also good when you want to show subdivisions in your dataset. Line charts can be used for change-over-time as well as showing correlations in time-based data sets.

## Axis & Axis Labeling
All basic charts that show quantitative data have a vertical and horizontal axis. In order to understand a graphic, the title, subtitle and axis labels need to be simple and concise.
