Almost all basic charts for our online platform are done in Q. Only charts with details and annotations that are not possible in Q should be designed and uploaded through Q's Infographic tool. The print template for basic charts can be downloaded via the [assets page](assets).

Basic bar charts are usually used for showing categorized data over time or comparing. Stacking bars are also good when you want to show subdivisions in your dataset. Line charts can be used for change-over-time as well as showing correlations in time-based data sets.

## Axis & Axis Labeling
All basic charts that show quantitative data have a vertical and horizontal axis. In order to understand a graphic, the title, subtitle and axis labels need to be simple and concise.

### Y-Axis
Do right-align and equally space labels from y-axis lines.
Do not extend lines underneath/above labels.

```

```
### X-Axis
Do remove year labels when several years are displayed and the *focus of the graphic is the trend*.
Do not keep all full years in the axis.
When necessary, abbreviate the year to the last two digits for years between first and last.
Do right-align and equally space labels from y-axis lines.
Do not extend lines underneath/above labels.

```

### Direct Annotation
Do write axis directly when data is not specified in subtitle.
Do simplify axis (remove) when values can be directly annotated.
Do not leave axes indescript.
Do not display axis and exact values directly annotated.
