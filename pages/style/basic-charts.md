Almost all basic charts for our online platform are done in Q. Only charts with details and annotations that are not possible in Q should be designed and uploaded through Q's Infographic tool. The print template for basic charts can be downloaded via the [assets page](assets).

Basic bar charts are usually used for showing categorized data over time or comparing. Stacking bars are also good when you want to show subdivisions in your dataset. Line charts can be used for change-over-time as well as showing correlations in time-based data sets.

## Axis & Axis Labeling
All basic charts that show quantitative data have a vertical and horizontal axis. In order to understand a graphic, the title, subtitle and axis labels need to be simple and concise.

### Y-Axis
Do right-align and equally space labels from y-axis lines.
Do not extend lines underneath/above labels.

```
```image

span: 6

```
### X-Axis
Do remove year labels when several years are displayed and the *focus of the graphic is the trend*.
Do not keep all full years in the axis.
When necessary, abbreviate the year to the last two digits for years between first and last.
Do right-align and equally space labels from y-axis lines.
Do not extend lines underneath/above labels.

```

### Direct Annotation
Do write axis directly when data is not specified in subtitle.
Do simplify axis (remove) when values can be directly annotated.
Do not leave axes indescript.
Do not display axis and exact values directly annotated.

```

### Legends
Legends are a part of the introduction to the chart, so we place them prominently just above the data. Legends for basic charts are constructed with circles and 45 degree lines. All charts with filled areas receive filled circles for their legend definitions and all line charts receive lines (solid or dotted) for their definitions.
Do align legends to the left of the chart, even with titles and subtitles
Do not put legend information below a chart or map
Do use dotted lines for prognosis or prediction in line charts
Do use hatched areas for prognosis or prediction in bar charts
