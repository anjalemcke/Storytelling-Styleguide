Almost all basic charts for our online platform are done in Q. Only charts with details and annotations that are not possible in Q should be designed and uploaded through Q's Infographic tool. The print template for basic charts can be downloaded via the [assets page](assets).

Basic bar charts are usually used for showing categorized data over time or comparing. Stacking bars are also good when you want to show subdivisions in your dataset. Line charts can be used for change-over-time as well as showing correlations in time-based data sets.

## Axis & Axis Labeling
All basic charts that show quantitative data have a vertical and horizontal axis. In order to understand a graphic, the title, subtitle and axis labels need to be simple and concise.

### Y-Axis

#### Do
- right-align and equally space labels from y-axis lines
- for print, align axis line to the baseline of the label
- for online, center the axis line to the label
- directly label the y-axis when the type of value represented is not obvious to the reader
- reduce long numbers when possible (3,000 to 3 with "in Tausend" in subtitle)

#### Do not
- extend lines underneath/above labels

```

plain: true
span: 6
src: "assets/basic-charts/bar-charts_axis-print@1x.png 1x, assets/basic-charts/bar-charts_axis-print@2x.png 2x"
```
### X-Axis

#### Do
- remove year labels when several years are displayed and the *focus of the graphic is the trend*.
- When necessary, abbreviate the year to the last two digits for years between first and last.
- right-align and equally space labels from y-axis lines.

#### Do not
- Do not keep all full years in the axis.
- Do not extend lines underneath/above labels.

```

span: 6
src: "assets/basic-charts/bar-charts_axis-b-print@1x.png 1x, assets/basic-charts/bar-charts_axis-b-print@2x.png 2x"
```

### Direct Annotation

#### Do
- write axis directly when data is not specified in subtitle.
- simplify axis (remove) when values can be directly annotated.

#### Do not
- leave axes indescript.
- display axis and exact values directly annotated.

```image
plain: true
span: 6
src: "assets/basic-charts/bar-charts_axis-c@1x.png 1x, assets/basic-charts/bar-charts_axis-c@2x.png 2x"
```
```image
plain: true
span: 6
src: "assets/basic-charts/bar-charts_axis-c-print@1x.png 1x, assets/basic-charts/bar-charts_axis-c-print@2x.png 2x"
```

### Legends
Legends are a part of the introduction to the chart, so we place them prominently just above the data. Legends for basic charts are constructed with circles and 45 degree lines. All charts with filled areas receive filled circles for their legend definitions and all line charts receive lines (solid or dotted) for their definitions.
#### Do
- align legends to the left of the chart, even with titles and subtitles
- use dotted lines for prognosis or prediction in line charts
- use hatched areas for prognosis or prediction in bar charts
- use a light gray area for missing data and directly label it (n/a or no data) when possible

#### Do not
- put legend information below a chart or map
- used hatched areas for other use cases outside of prognosis or prediction
