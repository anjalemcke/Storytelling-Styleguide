## Pie Charts
Pie charts are popular and often requested by editors. They are, however, rarely the best chart type to visualise what we want to communicate. We use pie charts with caution and whenever we think about using one, we pause to think: Is this really what makes most sense?

#### Rule of thumb:
If I combine all segments except for the most important one to "others" â€“ does the chart still make sense?
No? Then don't use a pie chart.

### Don't

We don't use pie charts to compare the size of various parts of a whole.

```image
plain: true
span: 6
src: "assets/guidelines/pie-dont.png"
```

We don't use pie charts to compare the parts of two or more 

```image
plain: true
span: 6
src: "assets/guidelines/pie-dont2.png"
```

### Do

We use pie charts to highlights how small or how large one part of a whole is.

```image
plain: true
span: 6
src: "assets/guidelines/pie-do.png"
```

In this case: 
- We never show more than 5 segments. Combine to "others" if necessary.
- The segment starts at the top and goes clockwise.
