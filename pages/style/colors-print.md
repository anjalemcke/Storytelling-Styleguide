...Some text here about how the colors were developed. Leann should be responsible for providing the content for this page.

For illustrations and when using a color as a background, all colors can be stepped lighter by using an opacity of 75%, 50% or 25%.


## Qualitative Color Scale: Primary
Our qualitative colors for daily business are the most used colors in our color palette. These colors should be used *in order* for different or "unrelated" categories within a dataset. Such a dataset could be countries, religions, or breeds of dogs. We use them in the order listed below.

```color
span: 2
name: "Blue (100, 60, 10, 25)"
value: "#083069"
```
```color
span: 2
name: "Yellow (5, 27, 90, 1)"
value: "#F0B517"
```
```color
span: 2
name: "Orange (13, 74, 94, 2)"
value: "#D93E0D"
```
```color
span: 2
name: "Turquoise (51, 5, 23, 1)"
value: "#7CC0AE"
```
```color
span: 2
name: "Pink (6, 50, 22, 1)"
value: "#E87D92"
```
```color
span: 2
name: "Gray (37, 29, 30, 10)"
value: "#908B84"
```


## Qualitative Color Scale: Choice
Our choice colors are less often used in our basic daily business. They are most often included in graphics larger than 2 columns or a part of a running series.

```color

value: "#AC8E46"
```
```color
span: 2
name: "Green-gray (55, 31, 38, 13)"

```
```color
span: 2
name: "Red (0, 90, 60, 10)"
value: "#E11832"
```
```color
span: 2
name: "Dark Red (30, 83, 67, 30)"
value: "#7C1C23"
```

## Karten

```
```color

```

## Political Party Colors
For print, we have predefined colors for the Swiss political parties. When other colors are needed for a country, please do the research to find out what color the party identifies with and then choose from a similar color already defined. For example, if the People's Party in Spain identifies with a lighter blue, you could take the blue currently defined for FDP in the Switzerland. Please try to remain consistent between each other in the infographic team.
