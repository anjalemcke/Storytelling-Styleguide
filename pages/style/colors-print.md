## Qualitative Color Scale: Primary
Our qualitative colors for daily business are the most used colors in our color palette. These colors should be used *in order* for different or "unrelated" categories within a dataset. Such a dataset could be countries, religions, or breeds of dogs. We use them in the order listed below.

```color
span: 1
name: "Blue"
value: "#083069"
```
```color
span: 1
name: "Yellow"
value: "#F0B517"
```
```color
span: 1
name: "Orange"
value: "#D93E0D"
```
```color
span: 1
name: "Turquoise"
value: "#7CC0AE"
```
```color
span: 1
name: "Pink"
value: "#E87D92"
```
```color
span: 1
name: "Gray"
value: "#908B84"
```


## Qualitative Color Scale: Choice
Our choice colors are less often used in our basic daily business. They are most often included in graphics larger than 2 columns or a part of a running series.

```color
span: 1
name: "Gold"
value: "#AC8E46"
```
```color
span: 1
name: "Green-gray"
value: "#65776F"
