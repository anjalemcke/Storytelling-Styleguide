# Principles for Visual Hierarchy

## Introducing the reader to the data
Some stuff about einstieg and einf√ºhrung and why it's important.

[example here]

## Guiding the reader through the data
Some text about using leserbeispielen, how to construct them and how to write for them. Maybe also show an example of a type of graphic that users are used to reading or has many details in it.

[example here]

## Annotations
Something about annotations, when they are important and how much they should be used. Graphic/Text balance.

[example here]

## Communication over decoration
Use color, illustrations and icons to communicate and explain the data that you're displaying. When the illustration helps the reader get a better understanding of what they're looking at on the first look, then it's a good use of illustration. Illustrations and icons should add information and provide context to the data you're showing in the chart. The illustration should also not compete with the main message of the chart.

#### Do use illustration
to give readers an entrance into complex dataset
- to provide context that is not included in the dataset
- when it can be a replacement for a lot of text or an image that will crowd or disturb the visual hierarchy
 Remember to try and reuse illustrations or icons to create consistency across our illustrative works

#### Do not use illustration
- to fill up empty space in a chart
- as the focal point of a visualization

[example here]

#### Do use a background color
- to balance the visual weight of the graphic with another image on the page
- to create a focal point in a sea of text
- to bring elements/separate charts in the same visualization together  
Remember to leave enough space between design elements and the edge of a background. When type or charts bump up against the border of a background it creates irritation for the eye.

#### Do not use a background color
- for online graphics as it creates contrast issues for readability on the screen
