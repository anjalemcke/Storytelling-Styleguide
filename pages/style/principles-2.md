# Visual Principles

## Introducing the reader to the data
The information we show through our graphics have a range of complexity. Our work is largely centered around breaking down complex themes or dense datasets, which means we need to find ways to display this information in an understandable format for our readers. Often we can count on basic chart types like bar and line charts to show our data but occasionally we use more complex visualizations that might require a little more introduction for our regular readers. No matter the complexity of the chart, we strive to create a clear introduction to each chart with a main message in the title. The following subtitle and legend provide a straight forward description of exactly what the chart is showing.

```

## Guiding the reader through the data
Some text about using leserbeispielen, how to construct them and how to write for them. Maybe also show an example of a type of graphic that users are used to reading or has many details in it.

## Annotations
Something about annotations, when they are important and how much they should be used. Graphic/Text balance.

## Communication over decoration
Use color, illustrations and icons to communicate and explain the data that you're displaying. When the illustration helps the reader get a better understanding of what they're looking at on the first look, then it's a good use of illustration. Illustrations and icons should add information and provide context to the data you're showing in the chart. The illustration should also not compete with the main message of the chart.

#### Do use illustration
to give readers an entrance into complex dataset
- to provide context that is not included in the dataset
- when it can be a replacement for a lot of text or an image that will crowd or disturb the visual hierarchy
 Remember to try and reuse illustrations or icons to create consistency across our illustrative works

[example here]

#### Do not use illustration
- to fill up empty space in a chart
- as the focal point of a visualization

[example here]

#### Do use a background color
- to balance the visual weight of the graphic with another image on the page
- to create a focal point in a sea of text
- to bring elements/separate charts in the same visualization together  
Remember to leave enough space between design elements and the edge of a background. When type or charts bump up against the border of a background it creates irritation for the eye.

#### Do not use a background color
- for online graphics as it creates contrast issues for readability on the screen
