# Principles for Visual Hierarchy

## Introducing the reader to the data
Some stuff about einstieg and einführung and why it's important.

[example here]

## Guiding the reader through the data
Some text about using leserbeispielen, how to construct them and how to write for them. Maybe also show an example of a type of graphic that users are used to reading or has many details in it.

[example here]

## Präzis
Something about annotations, when they are important and how much they should be used. Graphic/Text balance.

[example here]
