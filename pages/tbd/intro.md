# TBD

The Storytelling Styleguide is a "living styleguide" that's constantly growing. We therefore want to address the bigger problems and questions we're facing in our daily work. As a team we want to discuss the topics with no easy answer and want to find valid and workable solutions together.

First of all, these questions need to be asked and to be collected. We're listing all the things that need _TDB_ – to be defined (or designed) – on an office board.

# Workflow

In general the workflow looks like this:

- **Always collect new topics**
- **Pick 2 or 3 topics** from the collection / wall
- **Delegate topics to persons** to develop solutions
- **Discuss solutions** to find a consent
- **Finalize and document solution**

## Pick and delegate topics

_Frequency: Every month_
Together we look at our board and choose the 2 or 3 most important topics we listed. We discuss all of them and exchange opionions about it. Then we delegate each topic to a person who's responsible to develop a solution for it. Find the currently discussed topics [here](tbd-topics).

## Discuss solutions

_Frequency: Every week_
The persons responsible for developing solutions show their work in progress. We discuss what we think of the solution and its direction. If we all agree to the result, finalization is required.

## Finalize and document solution

Whenever a solution has been approved as workable, the following things need to be done:

- The solution has to be documented with a list of arguments here in catalog
- Example images for online and print style have to be provided here in catalog
- The solution should possibly implemented as
  - Sophie module (and link it in catalog) or Q feature/fix
  - Solution in [Sue](https://sue.st.nzz.ch/) (i.e. style update or augmentation concept)
  - Editor template or reference (i.e. craft library)
